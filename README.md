# go-api-kubernetes

## Purpose  
`go-api` is a simple HTTP API designed to help test and validate a complete DevOps workflow, including:  

- Kubernetes cluster and node setup  
- Containerized deployment in Kubernetes pods  
- CI/CD pipeline configuration using Jenkins  
- Helm-based deployment management  

The API itself is minimalâ€”just a basic HTTP service. The main focus is testing and refining the larger DevOps workflow.  

## What is it?  
`go-api` is a containerized Go application deployed in Kubernetes pods. It serves as a test application to evaluate:  

- Kubernetes cluster functionality  
- Node interactions  
- CI/CD pipeline automation  
- Helm chart deployment  

This project enables hands-on testing of DevOps processes from development to deployment.
